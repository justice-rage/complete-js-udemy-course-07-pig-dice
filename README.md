# _Pig Dice_

#### By _**Justice Douglas**_

## Description

_This is a web appliction game where two players battle until one of them successfully achieves a score of 100. The game starts with player 1 rolling the dice, and each dice roll result adds to the player's current score. However, if the current player rolls a 1, it automaticallys ends their turn and their current score is reduced to 0. To avoid this, players can elect to hold their score which will change player turns but add their current score to their own total game score in the quest to reach 100 before the other player does._
